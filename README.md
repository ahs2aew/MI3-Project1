## Contents
This repository contains materials relevant to DS 4002, "Data Science Project Course", 
this project aims to assess the reasons for movement for share of movers (within the US) and what 
percentage of movers picked specific reasons, with our hypothesis focusing on the main reason of movement 
being housing related issues. This repository will include the source folder, data used, figures produced, and 
references that were used. 

### SRC Section

Installing and building the code:
To run code download the excel file titled â€œhst_mig_a_5(4).xlsx and save it in the same 
workspace as the MI2-DS4002-Project1.Rmd file. Once the workspace is set to the directory 
you saved the Rmd file in, you are able to run the code directly from the rmd file.

Using the code: 
You will be able to run the Rmd file, which will manipulate and clean the dataframe and produce the visualizations. 

To run the regression, download the data titled "RegressionData-Project1-4002.xlsx". Also download the Stata .do file.
Open stata and run the do file with the data. You may have to change the "import data" line to ensure that 
Stata is using the data that is downloaded on your computer. This code will run a regression and produce the regression
output.
